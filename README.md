This is a basic blackjack game written in Javscript/jQuery as a portfolio piece.

# How to play
Press the Hit button to add a card to your hand<br />
Press the Stand button to stick with your current hand and start the dealer's turn<br />
Press the + or - buttons to increase/decrease your bet<br />
Winning the hand doubles your bet<br />

#On the Todo list
Reset available funds balance if the player's balance reaches zero - currently the only way to do this is to refresh the page<br />
Set different amounts for increasing/decreasing the bet - currently the bet increases/decreases by 10<br />
Add a better messaging system to let the player know if they win or lose<br />
Better use of available screen space<br />
Tidy up the code a little bit more - too much repetition for my liking
